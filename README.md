Triplogic is an open-source taxi app. This repository contains the code for REST API which is built using Java. 

This software is developed with an intent to help small entrepreneurs and muncipal corporations create their own taxi app.
So that they are not dependent on large organizations for taxi service. And so that they can customize the service according to their local needs. 

Triplogic is conceptually similar to Sidecar App which has now shutdown its services. The conceptual similarity is coincidental as the designers were not aware of sidecar app at the time of development.

The user can simply send the pickup request and call up the driver and the driver will come to pick the user.
